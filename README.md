# CSCI 5105 Mini Project - Distributed File System

A simple distributed file system allowing multiple clients to share files among each other concurrently. The system consists of 7 file servers allowing clients to share files together. We ensured file replication and data consistency using Quorum-based protocol and tested with about 10+ clients concurrently performing read/write operations successfully.
